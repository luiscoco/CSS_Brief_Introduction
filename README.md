# CSS: brief introduction

https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML)

CSS defines how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media

## Basics of CSS

CSS is used to control the layout of web pages with styles and design elements such as colors, fonts, and spacing

It allows you to apply styles to HTML elements selectively, using selectors based on element types, class names, ID, or attributes

## Example of CSS

Here's a basic example of CSS where we style a simple HTML document to change the color and font size of a paragraph:

**HTML File (index.html)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p class="content">This is a sample paragraph to demonstrate CSS styling.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS File (style.css)**

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
}

h1 {
    color: navy;
}

.content {
    color: #555;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

## How to Use CSS in VSCode

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular editor for web development that supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other languages. Hereâ€™s how you can start using CSS in VSCode:

**Open VSCode**: Start by opening Visual Studio Code

**Create a New Project**: Go to File -> New File or open an existing project with HTML files

**Add a CSS File**: You can create a new CSS file by going to File -> New File and saving it with a .css extension

**Link CSS to HTML**: Ensure your HTML file links to the CSS file using the <link> tag in the <head> section

**Write Your CSS**: Use the CSS file to define styles for HTML elements

**Preview Your Page**: You can preview your web page by opening the HTML file in a web browser or using a live server extension in VSCode

VSCode also provides helpful features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and linting for CSS, making it easier to write and debug your stylesheets

Additionally, the VSCode marketplace offers extensions like Live Server that can help you see changes in real time as you develop your web pages
